# LEGO EV3 Line Robot - Group 9 DML


## Lego EV3 Line Robot 
## Project Summary 

The Lego Line Follower Robot project is designed to showcase the application of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principls in a tangible, real-world scenario using the Lego EV3 robotics kit and the LeJOS Java Library. This project involves building a robot capable of autonomously following a line on a track, detecting obstacles and avoiding them while staying on the path. 

The Project integrates several key functionalities, including the use of ultrasonic sensors for object detection, color sensors, for line tracking, and motors for movement control. The robot is programmed to follow the track using precise timing techniques, handle obsracles by performing avoidance maneuvers, and return to the track seamlessly after detouring around obstracles. 

in addition to the core functionality, the project emphasizes the importance of using threads for concurrent task management, allowing for smooth sensor data collection and motor control in parallel. The communication between these threads is implemented following best practices for thread synchronization. 

The project is developed following programming practises, including clear code structure, modularity, and JavaDoc documentation. The group also have focused on documenting the process throght Jira and Confluence. 

Overall, this project aims to reinforce key concepts of Object Oriented programming through practicle application, while also offering a fun and interactive way to learn about robotics and sensor integration.

> Java               - Object Oriented Programming for controlling the robot. <br>

## Setup and Installation 

1.  Install LeJOS Follow the Installation guide.   <br> 
2. Clone the repository <br> 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LIENPHAM-HAMK/LineRobotDML.git         
```                                    
3. Connect Lego EV3 to your computer <br>
4. Complie and upload code to EV3 using the LeJOS development tools. <br> 


## Usage

1. Make sure your Lego EV3 robot is powered on. <br>
2. Run the complie.bat and process.bat in VS code <br>
3. Upload the .jar file in the console <br>
4. Run the uploaded .jar file <br>
5. The robot will start following the track and detecting the objects, and perform the avoidance maneuvers. <br>

## Sensors and Motors 
> Ultrasonic Sensors : used for Object Detection <br>
> Color Sensor       : Detects the line and changes in light intensity <br>
> Motors             : Control the movement of the Robot <br>
