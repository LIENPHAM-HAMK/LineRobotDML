# LEGO EV3 Line Robot - Group 9 DML
Line Robot follower
## Lego EV3 Line Robot 
## Project Summary 
This course focuses on advancing students understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) through a hands-on, team based project. During the inital weeks, students engage in preparatory learning activities to strengthen our grasp of core OOP concepts. The primary practical assignemtn invoolves designing and develiping a Lego EV3 line follower robot using the LeJOS java platform. This project serves as a tagible and interactuve way to apply object-oriented principles, making concepts such as classes and objects more concrete. 

The project emphazises both collaborative development and technical implementation, requiring teams to integrate various components including motors, color and ultrasonic sensors, and thread communication. key functionalities include line following, object detection and avoidance, and times navigation.

## Technology Used 

> LeJOS Java Library - For programming Lego EV3 robot.<br>
> Lego EV3 Hardware  - Motors, Sensors, and the Lego EV3 brick. <br>
> Java               - Object Oriented Programming for controlling the robot. <br>

## Setup and Installation 

1.  Install LeJOS Follow the Installation guide.   <br> 
2. Clone the repository <br> 
```bash <br>
git clone https://github.com/              
```                                    
3. Connect Lego EV3 to your computer <br>
4. Complie and upload code to EV3 using the LeJOS development tools. <br> 


## Usage

> Make sure your Lego EV3 robot is powered on. <br>
> Run the complie.bat and process.bat in VS code <br>
> Upload the .jar file in the console <br>
> Run the uploaded .jar file <br>
> The robot will start following the track and detecting the objects, and perform the avoidance maneuvers. <br>

## Sensors and Motors 
> Ultrasonic Sensors : used for Object Detection <br>
> Color Sensor       : Detects the line and changes in light intensity <br>
> Motors             : Control the movement of the Robot <br>
